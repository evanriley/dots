Here be my dotfiles


* TODO
- Bootstrap new linux installations
- macOS support

* FIXME
- auto switch between dark and light mode throughout the day
  - I may give up on this, kind of a hassle for little gain.
- nvim config
  - started to redo, remembered I spend all my time in emacs anyway and stopped
  - i still use it for some quick fixes so it probably shouldn't be as ass as it is.
