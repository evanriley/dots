## Defaults to true. This matches history against a set of default regex, and will not save it if we get a match. Defaults include
## 1. AWS key id
## 2. Github pat (old and new)
## 3. Slack oauth tokens (bot, user)
## 4. Slack webhooks
## 5. Stripe live/test keys
secrets_filter = true
## Defaults to true. If enabled, upon hitting enter Atuin will immediately execute the command. Press tab to return to the shell and edit.
# This applies for new installs. Old installs will keep the old behaviour unless configured otherwise.
enter_accept = false

## Defaults to "emacs".  This specifies the keymap on the startup of `atuin
## search`.  If this is set to "auto", the startup keymap mode in the Atuin
## search is automatically selected based on the shell's keymap where the
## keybinding is defined.  If this is set to "emacs", "vim-insert", or
## "vim-normal", the startup keymap mode in the Atuin search is forced to be
## the specified one.
# keymap_mode = "auto"

## Cursor style in each keymap mode.  If specified, the cursor style is changed
## in entering the cursor shape.  Available values are "default" and
## "{blink,steady}-{block,underline,bar}".
# keymap_cursor = { emacs = "blink-block", vim_insert = "blink-block", vim_normal = "steady-block" }

# network_connect_timeout = 5
# network_timeout = 5

## Timeout (in seconds) for acquiring a local database connection (sqlite)
# local_timeout = 5

## Set this to true and Atuin will minimize motion in the UI - timers will not update live, etc.
## Alternatively, set env NO_MOTION=true
# prefers_reduced_motion = false

[stats]
## Set commands where we should consider the subcommand for statistics. Eg, kubectl get vs just kubectl
# common_subcommands = [
#   "apt",
#   "cargo",
#   "composer",
#   "dnf",
#   "docker",
#   "git",
#   "go",
#   "ip",
#   "kubectl",
#   "nix",
#   "nmcli",
#   "npm",
#   "pecl",
#   "pnpm",
#   "podman",
#   "port",
#   "systemctl",
#   "tmux",
#   "yarn",
# ]

## Set commands that should be totally stripped and ignored from stats
# common_prefix = ["sudo"]

## Set commands that will be completely ignored from stats
# ignored_commands = [
#   "cd",
#   "ls",
#   "vi"
# ]

[keys]
# Defaults to true. If disabled, using the up/down key won't exit the TUI when scrolled past the first/last entry.
# scroll_exits = true

[sync]
# Enable sync v2 by default
# This ensures that sync v2 is enabled for new installs only
# In a later release it will become the default across the board
records = true

[preview]
## which preview strategy to use to calculate the preview height (respects max_preview_height).
## possible values: auto, static
## auto: length of the selected command.
## static: length of the longest command stored in the history.
## fixed: use max_preview_height as fixed height.
# strategy = "auto"

[daemon]
## Enables using the daemon to sync. Requires the daemon to be running in the background. Start it with `atuin daemon`
# enabled = false

## How often the daemon should sync in seconds
# sync_frequency = 300

## The path to the unix socket used by the daemon (on unix systems)
## linux/mac: ~/.local/share/atuin/atuin.sock
## windows: Not Supported
# socket_path = "~/.local/share/atuin/atuin.sock"

## Use systemd socket activation rather than opening the given path (the path must still be correct for the client)
## linux: false
## mac/windows: Not Supported
# systemd_socket = false

## The port that should be used for TCP on non unix systems
# tcp_port = 8889

# [theme]
## Color theme to use for rendering in the terminal.
## There are some built-in themes, including the base theme ("default"),
## "autumn" and "marine". You can add your own themes to the "./themes" subdirectory of your
## Atuin config (or ATUIN_THEME_DIR, if provided) as TOML files whose keys should be one or
## more of AlertInfo, AlertWarn, AlertError, Annotation, Base, Guidance, Important, and
## the string values as lowercase entries from this list:
##    https://ogeon.github.io/docs/palette/master/palette/named/index.html
## If you provide a custom theme file, it should be  called "NAME.toml" and the theme below
## should be the stem, i.e. `theme = "NAME"` for your chosen NAME.
# name = "autumn"

## Whether the theme manager should output normal or extra information to help fix themes.
## Boolean, true or false. If unset, left up to the theme manager.
# debug = true

[search]
## The list of enabled filter modes, in order of priority.
## The "workspace" mode is skipped when not in a workspace or workspaces = false.
## Default filter mode can be overridden with the filter_mode setting.
# filters = [ "global", "host", "session", "workspace", "directory" ]
